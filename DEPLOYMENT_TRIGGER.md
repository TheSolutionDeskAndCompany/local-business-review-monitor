# Deployment Trigger

This file is created to force a fresh Vercel deployment.

**Issue:** Custom domain still serving old ReviewMonitor layout despite initial fixes.

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-09 11:43:38

**Aggressive Fixes Applied:**
- Enhanced cache-control headers with no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
- Added Pragma: no-cache and Expires: 0 headers
- Updated HTML cache-bust meta tag to current timestamp
- Force complete cache invalidation across all layers

**Previous Attempts:**
- Basic cache-control headers (insufficient)
- Password reset URL fix (completed)
- Standard deployment trigger (insufficient)

**Expected Result:** 
- ReviewReady branding should be live on custom domain
- Complete elimination of old layout/theme
- All recent UI improvements should be visible
- Aggressive cache busting should prevent future issues

**Current Status:** Aggressive cache-busting deployment ready
