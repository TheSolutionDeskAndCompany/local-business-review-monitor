# Deployment Trigger

This file is created to force a fresh Vercel deployment.

**Issue:** Domain is serving old ReviewMonitor layout instead of current ReviewReady code.

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-09 04:56:42

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added cache-control headers to vercel.json to prevent browser caching
- Fixed password reset URL generation to use production domain (reviewready.ca)
- Force cache invalidation for HTML/JS files while preserving static asset caching

**Expected Result:** 
- ReviewReady branding should be live
- /reset-password route should work (no 404)
- All recent UI improvements should be visible
- Password reset emails will contain correct domain links

**Current Status:** Deployment fixes applied, ready for redeploy
